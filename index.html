            Pretend You're GPT-2 is a Discord-based, secret identity game where players take turns impersonating a text-generating program.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a single prompt, a human and a machine will write two distinct texts. Can you guess which one was written by a human?
          </p>
          <p>
            Flex your inner neural networks and be the best mimic out there!

Why are you studying philosophy?<br/><br/>

This is an important question for me, because I consider Philosophy of Mind to be the most important discipline in philosophy.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Type <code>!start</code> to create a new game. You're the host.
            </li>
            <li>
              Type <code>!join</code> to join the current game. The host is automatically a part of the game, they don't need to join.
            </li>
            <li>
              After at least one player has joined, the host can type <code>!ready</code> to start playing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The bot will pick a mimic at random and DM them the prompt. The bot's own completion of the prompt is kept secret.
            </li>
            <li>
              As soon as the mimic sends a completed prompt back to the bot, the voting round begins. Two completions, üÖ∞Ô∏è and üÖ±Ô∏è, are revealed to the players. Every player who has joined the game needs to vote for one of the two completions. Players can also mention (<code>@someone</code>) other participants to incriminate them, if they think they know exactly who was the mimic.
            </li>
            <li>
              When all the players have voted, the results will be revealed. Score (theoretical) points by correctly guessing which text was generated by a human. Score bonus (theoretical) points for guessing exactly who wrote it.          
            </li>
            <li>
              Note: Players who haven't joined the game can still vote and incriminate during the voting round. They simply cannot be picked as a mimic.
